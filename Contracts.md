# _Team Agreement_

# Communication plan
How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?  What are some different communication styles you've exeperienced in the past? What are people's communication styles in your group?

_Examples:_ 
- _Remember to hold and lower hands in teams._
- _Pause for silence._  
- _Check-in on how the group is feeling._
- _Recognize someone else's communication style._

# Conflict Plan
How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?

_Examples:_ 
- _Check-ins - just being accountable and open with each other; Come from a place of kindness._
- _Use "I statements" - we aren't here to attack each other. "I feel \<single word emotion\> when \<objective statement\>" is great a framework_
- _Negotiation and pitch for five minutes (with a timer), and then agree and move forward with grace._

# Work plan
How we will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? How we’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems.

_Examples:_ 
- _Hold each other accountable._ 
- _Regular breaks._
- _Sprint check ins at the beginning of the day._
